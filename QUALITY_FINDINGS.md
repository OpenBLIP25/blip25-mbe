# blip25-mbe — audio-quality findings & improvement plan

**Date:** 2026-06-01
**Source:** synthesized from the `ambe3000-clone` chip-parity session (live
AMBE-3000R A/B on `pve`) plus this repo's inherited notes. Written for a
*fresh session* that wants to raise blip25-mbe's perceptual quality.

## Framing — what this document is and is NOT about

The sister project `ambe3000-clone` chases **bit-exact PCM** parity with the
AMBE-3000R. **That is explicitly out of scope here.** For blip25-mbe, ignore:

- floating-point vs fixed-point arithmetic differences,
- exact per-sample PCM sequences,
- raw harmonic **phase** offsets in steady voiced segments — the ear is
  largely insensitive to absolute harmonic phase in sustained voicing, so
  the chip-vs-ours phase scatter we measured (−167°…+150°) does **not** by
  itself cost quality. (Phase still matters in three narrow places — onsets,
  the V/UV boundary, and inter-frame continuity — flagged below.)

What this document **is** about: the places where blip25-mbe's perceived
audio quality (intelligibility, naturalness, timbre, transient clarity) falls
short of — and could ultimately exceed — the AMBE-3000R, on both **encode**
(PCM → bits) and **decode** (bits → PCM).

**Goal.** First reach parity with the AMBE-3000R; then exceed it. The chip is
1990s-era fixed-point silicon with known design compromises (catalogued in
`~/blip25-specs/analysis/ambe3000_chip_oracle_caveats.md`). Modern, float,
offline-capable code can beat several of them — but today blip25-mbe is **not
yet at parity**, so parity comes first.

## 0. Measure before optimizing — the attribution method

Quality work fails when you can't tell whether a deficit is in the **encoder**
or the **decoder**. We already have the instrument: the 4-cell matrix in
`conformance/speech-quality` (`ab-matrix`, `halfrate-ab-matrix`). Use it with a
**clean-speech reference** and a real perceptual scorer (PESQ wideband/POLQA;
confirm the scorer in `conformance/speech-quality` actually runs — the README
lists it as "later").

Drive clean speech `S` through every combination and PESQ each against `S`:

| cell | encoder | decoder | isolates |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| chip→chip | chip | chip | the bar to beat (AMBE-3000R end-to-end) |
| chip→ours | chip | **ours** | **decoder** quality (encoder held = chip) |
| ours→chip | **ours** | chip | **encoder** quality (decoder held = chip) |
| ours→ours | ours | ours | our end-to-end |

- `chip→ours` vs `chip→chip` ⇒ is our **decoder** ≥ the chip's?
- `ours→chip` vs `chip→chip` ⇒ is our **encoder** ≥ the chip's?
- A deficit in only one cell pinpoints the layer; a deficit in both is
  cumulative.

Run this on a diverse clean-speech corpus (male/female, several languages,
plus the DVSI `tv-rc/r33` `clean`, `dam*`, `fambf*`, `tambf*` vectors) **before**
touching code. Every change below should be validated as a PESQ delta in the
relevant cell, not by ear alone.

## 0a. Measured attribution — 2026-06-01 (clean-speech corpus, AMBE+2 half-rate)

Scorer stood up and confirmed running: `conformance/scripts/score_ab_matrix.py`
in the `~/.blip25-eval` venv (`pesq` + `pystoi`). **Band note:** the codec is
8 kHz / 4-kHz-band, so **narrowband PESQ (P.862) is the apples-to-apples metric**
and is the attribution basis. PESQ *wideband* (P.862.2) is only defined at
16 kHz — `pesq(8000,…,'wb')` hard-errors — so a supplementary `pesq_wb` column
was added that resamples 8→16 kHz; it is optimistic (the empty 4-8 kHz band
matches the reference) and is **not** used for attribution.

Corpus: `tv-rc` `clean, dam, fambf22c, fambm22a, tambf22a, tambf32b`, 1500
frames (30 s) each. Chip on `pve` (live AMBE-3000R). The chip natively runs
AMBE+2, so the **half-rate** matrix is a genuine oracle — that is where the
encoder/decoder attribution is valid. (Full-rate IMBE is *not* chip-orackable;
see `reference_chip_is_ambe_plus_2_only`. Full-rate is reported as self-quality
only: our_enc→our_dec mean PESQ-nb **3.06** vs clean ref.)

Baselines: `conformance/baselines/halfrate_ab_clean_corpus_2026-06-01.csv`,
`fullrate_self_corpus_2026-06-01.csv`.

**4-cell PESQ-nb deficits vs chip→chip (the bar):**

| vector | chip→chip | decoder (chip→ours) | encoder (ours→chip) | e2e (ours→ours) |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| clean    | 3.047 | −0.374 | −0.187 | −0.261 |
| dam      | 3.369 | −0.298 | −0.182 | −0.265 |
| fambf22c | 3.145 | −0.478 | −0.462 | −0.542 |
| fambm22a | 2.971 | −0.350 | −0.216 | −0.347 |
| tambf22a | 2.951 | −0.425 | −0.191 | −0.354 |
| tambf32b | 3.015 | −0.355 | −0.116 | −0.212 |
| **mean** | **3.083** | **−0.380** | **−0.226** | **−0.330** |

**Attribution: the DECODER is the dominant speech-quality deficit
(mean −0.38 PESQ), the encoder secondary (−0.23).** The decoder is the larger
deficit on every vector. This confirms **§2.1 (decode spectral-envelope
accuracy)** as the highest-scoring first lever, consistent with the §1
per-harmonic envelope evidence and the inherited "speech gap is decoder-side"
note. Encoder §3.1 (amplitude estimation) is the clear second lever.

Method caveat logged: on the first chip half-rate *encode* call of the session
(the `clean` vector) the chip emitted a low-energy/garbled bitstream
(chip→chip 1.16, RMS 237 vs ref 1307); a re-run after the chip was warm gave
the healthy 3.047 above. Treat the **first** chip-encode call per session as a
warm-up and re-run it. All other vectors were clean on the first pass.

---

## 1. Evidence collected this session (rate 33/34, AMBE+2 half-rate)

Probe: `ambe3000-clone/conformance/speech-quality/examples/phase_probe.rs`
feeds an identical **no-FEC (rate 34)** info vector to both the chip and our
decoder, so any divergence is pure decode-path (dequantize → §1.10 enhancement
→ synthesis), with the wire/FEC layer removed.

- **Decode spectral envelope diverges per-harmonic.** On a sustained voiced
  frame (leakage-free pitch ω₀ = π/20), the chip-vs-ours harmonic magnitude
  ratio ranged **0.59×–1.78×** — not a constant gain, a *shape* difference.
  Per-harmonic magnitude = timbre, and **timbre dominates perceived quality.**
  This is the single strongest decode-side lead.
- **Overall loudness** differed (~0.84× on that probe) but loudness is a
  consumer-layer concern (`CHIP_GAIN_CALIBRATION.md`); the *envelope shape* is
  the quality issue, not the scalar.
- **Inherited open quality items** (`SCOPE_PLAN.md`): 2-frame onset attack
  smearing on speech onsets; tonal-content deficit on `alert.pcm`. Both are
  audible-quality, not bit-exactness.
- **Encoder, per inherited `analysis-encode` conformance:** pitch and voicing
  track the chip reasonably, but **spectral-amplitude RMSE is large**. That is
  a direct encoder timbre deficit.

Caveat: the probe input is synthetic flat-amplitude voicing; **reproduce the
envelope-divergence measurement on real chip-encoded speech** (decode the same
`tv-rc/r33/clean.bit` through chip vs ours, compare per-frame harmonic
envelopes) before drawing strong conclusions.

> **Resolved 2026-06-01b** (see §2.1 "Progress …b" and
> `ambe3000-clone/docs/lsd_attribution_1a.md`): done on `clean/dam/fambf22c/tambf22a`.
> The synthetic probe's "0.59×–1.78× per-harmonic ratio" **overstates** the
> real-speech *envelope-shape* divergence — phase-/gain-invariant shape-LSD shows
> only ~3.6 dB true divergence, of which ≤0.10 dB is a correctable smooth envelope.
> The rest is per-harmonic scatter (phase/placement signature).

## 2. Decode-side quality levers (bits → PCM), prioritized

### 2.1 (HIGH) Spectral-envelope accuracy: dequantize + log-mag prediction + §1.10
The probe shows our decoded harmonic envelope differs in *shape* from the chip
on identical bits. Suspects, in order:

1. **Log-magnitude prediction recurrence.** On a steady signal the predictor
   should converge to a stable envelope; if our recurrence (coefficients,
   the `M̄_l` feedback) differs from the chip's, the whole envelope drifts
   frame-over-frame even on identical bits. Audit `ambe_plus2_wire::dequantize`
   `apply_log_prediction` against the derived spec; verify steady-state
   convergence by feeding a constant info vector and checking `M̄_l` is flat.
2. **§1.10 spectral enhancement** (`enhance_spectral_amplitudes`). This is the
   formant-sharpening stage; getting its weighting wrong tilts timbre. Compare
   pre- and post-enhancement envelopes against the chip's output envelope.
3. **PRBA/HOC dequantization** (`decode_prba_vector`, `inverse_block_dct`,
   `assemble_hoc_matrix`). A bug here mis-shapes the residual spectrum.

**Measure:** per-frame log-spectral distortion (LSD, dB) of our envelope vs the
chip's output envelope on real speech bits; target a steady decrease. **Steps:**
isolate each stage with a unit probe (constant info vector in → inspect
intermediate `M̄_l`), fix divergence, re-run `chip→ours` PESQ.

**Progress 2026-06-01 (this session):**
- **Where it diverges (localization).** Per-band output LSD of `chip→ours` vs
  `chip→chip` on identical chip bits (`/tmp/lsd_probe.py`, 6-vector corpus):
  total ~8.7–9.4 dB, **rising with frequency** — 0–1 kHz ≈ 7.0–8.1 dB,
  1–2 kHz ≈ 7.8–8.6, **2–3 kHz ≈ 9.0–9.8, 3–4 kHz ≈ 8.8–9.9**. The decode
  envelope diverges most in the **upper bands** (mid/high harmonics = brightness
  / formant detail). (Output-domain LSD is inflated by random-phase unvoiced
  synthesis, so use it for *localization*, not absolute envelope error.)
- **Suspect #1 (log-prediction recurrence) — CLEARED.** New probe
  `conformance/.../examples/halfrate_envelope_converge.rs` feeds a fixed steady
  voiced info vector through `apply_log_prediction` with one advancing
  `DecoderState`. The envelope converges monotonically; the frame-to-frame
  delta decays by exactly the **0.65 predictor coefficient** per frame
  (15.2 → 7.6 → 3.8 → 1.9 → … dB; <0.01 dB by frame 16 ≈ 320 ms). That settling
  is the predictor's spec-defined memory, shared by the chip; on continuous
  (always-warm) speech it is **not** the divergence source. Init transient
  (`prev_lambda=1.0`, `prev_l=15`) only matters for the first ~16 frames of a
  cold stream — negligible for the 1500-frame PESQ runs.
- **Next (SUPERSEDED by Progress 2026-06-01b below).** This bullet originally
  proposed a post-§1.10 `M̄_l` envelope probe to split §1.10 vs HOC. That probe
  was built and run (phase-/gain-invariant shape-LSD on the bit-exact oracle) —
  **§1.10 is cleared and the whole magnitude-envelope-shape lever is near-
  exhausted (≤0.10 dB ceiling).** Do not pursue §1.10/HOC envelope *tilt*
  tuning; the residual is per-harmonic micro-scatter, not a smooth envelope.
  See 2026-06-01b.

**Progress 2026-06-01b (real-speech shape-LSD attribution + adversarial verify):**
Built that probe in `ambe3000-clone` (`examples/lsd_attribute.rs`) — but with a
**phase-invariant, gain-invariant shape-LSD** (per-frame mean removed over voiced
harmonics, joint-LS harmonic extraction) and a measurement-floor control, on the
bit-exact chip oracle (`clean/dam/fambf22c/tambf22a`, ~5k voiced frames). A
10-agent adversarial workflow independently re-derived every number. Full writeup:
`ambe3000-clone/docs/lsd_attribution_1a.md`. Verdicts that bear on this lever:
- **Suspect #2 (§1.10) — CLEARED.** Enhancement is shape-neutral: component
  shape-LSD `E−D` ≈ 0.53 dB, R²≈0.11 with the chip mismatch. Not the source.
- **Suspect #3 + the prediction (the dequant stage, `D−chip`) is the dominant
  TRUE carrier** (shape-LSD ≈5.2–5.6 dB, R²≈0.50 — ~3× any other stage). The
  log-prediction is *cleared for steady-state convergence* (prior note) but on
  real speech it **undercorrects the inter-frame tilt by ~37%** (residual tilt
  positively coupled to the pre-prediction tilt, k≈0.37).
- **DECISIVE: the magnitude-envelope *shape* lever is near-exhausted.** An
  *ideal* per-decile EQ — the ceiling of any envelope/tilt/§1.10/predictor-
  coefficient fix — recovers only **0.04–0.10 dB** of shape-LSD; the smooth
  decile envelope explains just **1.5–3.5%** of the variance. ~97% of the true
  ~3.6 dB per-harmonic divergence is **per-harmonic scatter**, not a smooth
  envelope. The prior per-band ~8.7–9.4 dB output-LSD was (as flagged)
  random-phase-unvoiced + units inflated; the true voiced-envelope-shape error
  is ~3.6 dB and almost none of it is a correctable timbre tilt.
- **Implication for the −0.38 decoder PESQ deficit (quality framing).** It is
  **not** a smooth-envelope/timbre-*tilt* error (≤0.10 dB recoverable). The
  ~3.6 dB residual is **per-harmonic magnitude micro-scatter** — for *perceptual
  quality* that is the candidate lever (harmonic fine-structure / placement),
  **plus the three narrow phase cases this doc flags (onsets, V/UV boundary,
  inter-frame continuity)**; steady-voicing absolute phase stays inaudible per
  the §Framing note, so it is *not* the quality lever here. (For the sister
  fork's **bit-exact parity** goal the same residual *is* phase — its
  `phase_divergence` tool measures −2.4 dB voiced SNR, ~71° per-harmonic phase
  RMS — but that is a parity concern, not a blip25-mbe quality one. *Update
  2026-06-01:* a 40-pitch sweep there found the voiced phase error splits into a
  deterministic linear-in-l term **ΔΘ(ω₀)=66.87·ω₀−1.38** (a ~66.9-sample
  time-origin offset + a per-harmonic ψ ramp; affine in ω₀ alone) whose exact
  per-pitch removal lifts voiced SNR −2.25→+0.95 dB, leaving a ~55° per-harmonic
  residual. Still inaudible in steady voicing, so still not a quality lever — but
  the time-origin / fundamental-phase finding could matter for the *onset* and
  *inter-frame-continuity* phase cases this doc flags as quality levers; worth a
  listen if those are revisited. *Update 2026-06-02:* the parity fork found the
  AMBE-3000R **re-initializes its voiced-phase synthesizer to cold-start at every
  voiced frame following an unvoiced frame** (chip probe; post-unvoiced onset ==
  cold start to 2.3°, independent of the unvoiced segment's pitch/amplitude). This
  is directly the **onset / V-UV-boundary phase case** this doc flags: a
  deterministic phase RESET at voicing onsets, not a carried accumulator. For
  blip25-mbe quality it means onset phase coherence is a *defined* target (re-seed
  phase at voicing onsets) — plausibly audible as onset crispness — worth A/B'ing
  if the onset case is revisited; gated as `BLIP25_PHASE_UV_RESET` in the fork's
  `mbe_baseline.rs`. The dominant *steady*-run residual is a within-run time-shift
  τ that resists a closed form (likely fixed-point) — still inaudible, still
  parity-only. *Update 2026-06-02b (envelope→phase + V/UV boundary):* a dedicated
  chip envelope-sweep (`ambe3000-clone/conformance/baselines/envsweep_2026-06-02/`)
  found the AMBE-3000R's envelope→phase response **is minimum-phase** (Hilbert of
  log-envelope; cepstral corr 0.95, scale ~0.85) **applied to ALL harmonics** —
  whereas our regen exempts `l≤L̃/4` and uses γ=0.44 (a low scale). Matching the
  chip = drop the exemption + raise the scale (`BLIP25_REGEN_ALL`+`REGEN_SCALE≈1.2`).
  Inaudible in steady voicing (parity-only), BUT the chip also injects a **large
  phase perturbation at voiced harmonics adjacent to a VOICING BOUNDARY when it
  coincides with a formant** (synthetic formant all-voiced vs mixed-voiced: l near
  the boundary swings 90–170°). That is squarely the **V/UV-boundary phase case**
  this doc flags as a *quality* lever — worth A/B'ing for boundary crispness if the
  V/UV case is revisited. The bulk real-frame "content surface" is this static,
  envelope×voicing-dependent boundary phase, not a simple min-phase operator.) The only
  structural envelope handle left is the predictor
  coefficient — and it was **swept and confirmed near-dead**: the chip-matching
  optimum of the §2.13 `0.65` coefficient is ≈**0.68** (the ~37% undercorrection),
  improving apples-to-apples `pcm_lsd` uniformly across all four vectors by only
  **~0.07–0.09 dB** with no regression (`ambe3000-clone/conformance/baselines/r33_predcoef_sweep_2026-06-01.csv`).
  ~0.08 dB is the whole win — at the ≤0.10 dB ceiling — so it was not applied
  (also shared with the analysis-encoder roundtrip). Decode quality is **phase-
  limited, not envelope-limited.**

**Progress 2026-06-02 (ambe3000-clone magdyn chip campaign — CORRECTS the two
notes above).** A constant-pitch magnitude-step chip campaign
(`ambe3000-clone/conformance/baselines/magdyn_phase_2026-06-02/`) resolves the
real-frame "content surface":
- The chip's voiced phase is **MEMORYLESS in magnitude** — after a spectral step
  it converges to the cold-destination phase in ~6–8 frames, no persistent offset.
  So the content surface is **not** a voicing-boundary/dynamics term.
- The content surface **IS the min-phase Hilbert operator** on the instantaneous
  envelope (chip-validated corr 0.96 vs our `ambe_phase_regen` on the chip's
  extracted M̄_l), applied to **ALL** harmonics — the chip does NOT use the
  `l≤⌊L̃/4⌋` regen exemption (REGEN_ALL). This **overturns** the "not a simple
  min-phase operator" note above.
- **The per-harmonic envelope micro-scatter (the ≤0.10 dB residual) is the SYNTH
  TRANSFER, not dequant/§1.10.** On cold probes (chip & ours decode the SAME
  codeword) the realized envelope ripples 46% (chip) vs 29% (ours); dequant is
  faithful (±0.17 log2) and §1.10 is a near no-op (ripple 0.29 enh vs 0.31 no-enh).
  The divergence is the chip's fixed-point synthesis reconstruction (window/DFT-256/
  OLA), partly a fixed H(ν). For perceptual quality this is the **envelope-shape +
  phase-coherence** lever (via the min-phase operator it couples magnitude and
  phase): matching the synth reconstruction would sharpen formant detail AND
  improve the onset/boundary phase coherence this doc flags. For bit-exact parity
  it is the unified decode target (the varying-pitch ψ/τ is separate).

**Progress 2026-06-03 (ambe3000-clone — §1.10 is WRONG-SIGNED vs the chip on real
speech; dequant wordlength is chip-observable ~Q5).** Sharpening the earlier
"§1.10 near no-op" note with the phase-invariant shape-LSD-vs-cached-chip-PCM
instrument on the 4 real-speech vectors
(`ambe3000-clone/conformance/baselines/enh_chip_wordlength_2026-06-03/`):
- **§1.10 makes the chip-envelope match WORSE, consistently.** `lsd_E−lsd_D = +0.09 dB`
  on all 4 files; per-frame the spec §1.10 hurts 72–75% of voiced frames (median
  +0.10 dB), strengthening to 77–82% on high-energy well-voiced frames. Relaxing
  the Eq.108 clamps to sharpen MORE degrades monotonically; the floor is at
  enhancement OFF. A pure linear-in-l tilt null-test matches/beats the structured
  clamp ⇒ the residual past "off" is a mild high-frequency ROLLOFF (the voiced
  synth-H(f)), not the §1.10 law. End-to-end `BLIP25_NO_ENHANCE` improves
  `pcm_lsd` (chip-PCM vs our-PCM) on all 4 files (~−0.05 dB).
- **Quality implication (the "exceed" framing).** The chip applies essentially NO
  spectral-amplitude sharpening on the half-rate path — its envelope is not
  formant-sharpened the way spec §1.10 prescribes. For *chip parity* that means
  turn §1.10 off. For *blip25-mbe quality* the inverse: the chip's lack of §1.10
  sharpening is plausibly a chip **limitation**, so spec §1.10 (or a better-tuned
  enhancement) stays a candidate "exceed" lever — do NOT remove it here on the
  strength of the parity result; A/B §1.10 sharpening for formant clarity instead.
- **Dequant log-mag wordlength is chip-observable at ~Q5** (≈0.19 dB log2 steps),
  via the same instrument over a fixed-point dequant gate — composes additively
  with §1.10-off (parity-only; envelope resolution, not a quality lever, but it
  bounds how fine the chip's magnitude representation actually is).

**Progress 2026-06-03b (ambe3000-clone — voiced phase-regen RE-TUNED + the
"min-phase operator explains ~half the voiced scatter" claim CORRECTED as
~⅔ overfitting).** Re-tuned the US5701390 regen against the 4 cached r33 vectors
(`phase_operator.rs` + `phase_divergence`, no live chip):
- **The chip's *effective* regen scale is BELOW the patent's γ=0.44, not above
  it.** Operator-fit on the chip's own phase gives s≈0.33–0.48 (nominal s=1.0 ⇔
  γ=0.44) ⇒ effective γ≈0.15–0.21, robust on all 4 vectors. End-to-end
  `phase_divergence` agrees: scale 0.4 **Pareto-dominates** the patent γ on all 4
  vectors on both the τ-removed per-harmonic phase residual (avg 71.65°→70.80°)
  and aligned voiced SNR (0.54→0.57 dB). **This OVERTURNS the 2026-06-01/-06-02
  note above that recommended `REGEN_SCALE≈1.2` + `REGEN_ALL`.** Wired
  `REGEN_SCALE_DEFAULT=0.4` as the AMBE+2 voiced default (regression test added);
  `REGEN_ALL` is a measured **NEGATIVE** (raises the residual) and stays OFF.
- **The "operator explains ~half the voiced scatter" (corr 0.96 / 53%) was ~⅔
  per-frame OVERFITTING.** A scrambled operator (same per-frame value
  distribution, harmonic alignment destroyed by reversal/roll) STILL scores
  31–36% under the free per-frame (s,τ,c) fit. The genuine reachable operator
  headroom is only ~8° (47°→39°), and most of *that* lives in the per-frame
  DC/φ₀ subspace the synth can't exploit without a free per-frame fundamental
  phase — hence turning the operator from OFF to full patent strength moves the
  end-to-end synth residual only ~0.3°. **§1.10-enhanced M̄_l as the operator
  input makes zero difference** (39.1°→39.2°), consistent with §1.10 being
  wrong-signed for this chip.
- **Net:** decode voiced quality is **NOT** regen-limited. The dominant reachable
  voiced lever is the **per-frame fundamental phase φ₀ + the within-run time-shift
  τ** (the content-dependent onset surface; `voiced-tau-is-onset-perrun-scalar`,
  `onset-formant-tau-content-not-minphase`), which the τ-only ceiling caps at
  ~+0.5 dB aligned SNR / ~70° residual. The regen retune is a small parity
  refinement, not a quality unlock.

**Progress 2026-06-03c (ambe3000-clone — voiced fundamental phase φ₀ pinned to a
chip-calibrated pitch law; first positive realized voiced-phase lever since
regen).** New tool `phase_phi0.rs` (per voiced frame, splits the chip-vs-our
phase error into a time-shift τ slope and an l-independent DC = φ₀; difference
and absolute fits; 4 cached r33 vectors, no live chip):
- **φ₀ IS content-determined** (scramble controls ≈0): a clean monotone
  **pitch-linear** component, `φ₀(ω₀) ≈ +22.6·ω₀ − 2.19 rad` (circular-linear
  r≈0.46 to ω₀), PLUS a genuine **per-run memory** (prev-φ₀ circ-circ r≈0.55 raw,
  0.46 after removing the ω₀ law — not a pitch-smoothness confound). It is **not**
  a free-running fundamental-phase accumulator (Δφ₀ vs ω₀·160 r≈0).
- **Realized** via a new `BLIP25_PHASE_CW` handle (φ₀=C+CW·ω₀ on the voiced
  harmonics; constants `PHI0_CW_VALIDATED=−22.6`, `PHI0_C_VALIDATED=2.19`,
  applied with the synth's internal sign, regression-guarded). Cross-validated
  (fit clean+dam / test famb+tamb — same optimum ridge). End-to-end
  `phase_divergence`: **beats the τ-only ceiling** — mean oracle-τ-aligned voiced
  SNR **+0.57→+1.09 dB**, per-harmonic resid **70.8°→68.8°**, raw SNR
  −2.41→−2.21 (never regresses). Kept env-gated/off by default (like N0/B).
- **Caveat / lever status:** the full φ₀ prize (≈12° per-harmonic given oracle τ)
  is **entangled with τ** — the DC helps raw bit-exact parity only modestly
  (+0.2 dB) because most of the gain is conditional on a correct per-frame τ, and
  the φ₀ memory is the same firmware-bound onset surface as τ. So φ₀ is a real
  *partial* quality lever (use the `BLIP25_PHASE_CW`/`_C` law if you want the
  voiced phase closer to the chip), but the voiced wall is still the τ + φ₀-memory
  onset content surface. Campaign:
  `conformance/baselines/voiced_phi0_2026-06-03/`.

### 2.2 (HIGH, the "exceed" win) Do NOT replicate the chip's quality-degrading artifacts
The chip applies beyond-spec behaviors that *hurt* quality
(`ambe3000_chip_oracle_caveats.md`): an amplitude-dependent **mute**, a hard
**±10000 internal cap**, a **stationary-signal smoother**, and a
**spectral-discontinuity attenuator** (transient ~27% RMS drop on large ΔL).
blip25-mbe's spec-faithful default should **not** copy these — by *not*
clamping/attenuating, our decoder can sound cleaner than the chip on dynamic
speech. (These belong only behind the opt-in `chip_compat` flag for emulation,
never on by default.) **Action:** confirm none of these are on by default;
A/B `chip→ours` vs `chip→chip` on dynamic/transient speech to claim the win.

### 2.3 (MED) Error-robustness: adaptive smoothing / repeat / mute (§1.11)
Under FEC errors (real RF traffic), repeat/mute decisions drive intelligibility.
The chip's recovery is a 1990s heuristic. **Exceed opportunity:** use the
soft-decision FEC metrics we already expose to do *graceful* spectral
interpolation across bad frames instead of hard repeat/mute. **Measure:** PESQ
vs clean ref on the `dam_e*` (error-injected) DVSI vectors, `chip→ours` vs
`chip→chip`.

### 2.4 (MED) Onset / transient clarity
The noted 2-frame onset attack smears consonants and word starts — a real
intelligibility cost. This is partly the synthesis window/overlap-add and the
voiced-onset phase/energy ramp. **Exceed opportunity:** shorter effective
attack via asymmetric/adaptive windowing at detected onsets. **Measure:** PESQ
+ STOI on plosive-rich speech; informal A/B on word onsets.

### 2.5 (LOW–MED) Voiced/unvoiced mix and tonal content
Unvoiced-band noise synthesis quality and the voiced/unvoiced crossover affect
"naturalness" and breathiness. Tonal inputs (`alert`, DTMF, Knox) have a noted
deficit; the half-rate Annex-T tone path bypasses MBE and should be exercised.
Phase only matters here at the boundary and for inter-frame continuity (avoid
clicks) — not as absolute offset.

**Unvoiced inter-band leak (2026-06-02, ambe3000-clone `dequant_probe_2026-06-02`).**
The spec's §1.12.1 per-frame DFT-256→band-shape→IDFT→OLA unvoiced synthesis has a
fixed **−17.9 dB inter-band leak**: each unvoiced peak band smears energy into its
neighbours (the per-frame ~160-sample effective window has ~−15 dB sinc sidelobes
at one-band-spacing). Measured against the AMBE-3000R with direct-index codewords
(chip and ours fed identical bits): the **chip leaks ~0** — its unvoiced spectrum
has near-perfect band isolation (shoulder ≈ M̃), so the chip renders sharper /
less-smeared unvoiced bands than our synthesis. Our flat→flat response is fine
(±0.3 dB); the leak only shows on peaky spectra. This is both a parity gap and a
**quality lever**: a sharper unvoiced spectrum (less band-to-band smear) is more
faithful to the input envelope. Reaching it needs **continuous per-band
bandpass-filtered noise** (a long, cross-frame-coherent effective window), not the
per-frame DFT-OLA — no window/taper/OLA knob reduces the −17.9 dB (all
−17.4…−18.3). NB: the half-rate DEQUANTIZER (gain/PRBA/HOC/DCT/§2.13 predictor) is
bit-faithful to the chip — the unvoiced envelope error is synthesis, not dequant.

**CORRECTION (2026-06-02, ambe3000-clone `wola_validate_2026-06-02`).** The
"continuous per-band bandpass-filtered noise / long cross-frame-coherent window"
fix above is **overturned at the waveform level.** It was implemented two ways
(long-window overlap-add WOLA + overlap-save OLS, both gated `BLIP25_UV_SYNTH`)
and measured by sample-xcorr vs the chip: the original per-frame 256-DFT-OLA
**best matches the chip's unvoiced waveform** — real-speech interior-unvoiced
xcorr old 0.842 > WOLA 0.689 > OLS 0.352; stationary flat probe old 0.967 > WOLA
0.907. WOLA *does* cut the −17.9 dB per-band POWER leak (notch −14.7→−27.6 dB)
but its long window blends overlapping noise blocks → smears the time-varying
envelope + noise phase → better power spectrum, WORSE waveform. So the inter-band
leak is a stationary-power-spectrum artifact, **NOT the perceptual/waveform
bottleneck** — don't chase it with a longer window. The real unvoiced lever is
the 256-path fine structure: the exact band-edge bin assignment (round-to-nearest
beats ceil on real speech, +0.4 dB SNR, pitch-dependent) and fixed-point
DFT/shaping precision. (Mechanism B: on extreme envelopes our §1.10 enhancement
hits the W_l upper clamp and boosts shoulders ×1.2 — a separate envelope lever
shared with voiced magnitude.)

**Voiced/unvoiced RMS ratio diverges by pitch (2026-06-03, ambe3000-clone
`vuv_codebook_recover_2026-06-03`).** Sweeping the V/UV pattern over a fixed base
frame (chip vs ours, same bits): as bands flip voiced, the **chip's output RMS
rises to a STABLE ~1.08×** the all-unvoiced level — pitch-independent (1.077 /
1.138 / 1.077 at f0≈249/207/120 Hz). **Our decoder's voiced RMS swings with
pitch**: 0.56–0.68× on sparse-harmonic frames (low/mid f0), ~1.01× on dense
(high-harmonic) frames. The base-dependence is the fingerprint of **phase
interference** in our voiced sinusoidal synthesis (few harmonics → coherent-phase
constructive/destructive swings dominate RMS; many harmonics → averages out),
whereas the chip's stable ratio implies its voiced harmonic phases are arranged
(or magnitudes normalized) to keep voiced level pitch-independent. ⇒ on low-pitch
voiced speech our output is audibly **too quiet** (down to ~0.6×), a perceptual
level error that is a direct manifestation of the voiced-phase/synthesis wall
(ambe3000-clone `voiced-phase-is-timeshift-tau` / onset-operator). Concrete chip
target: voiced/unvoiced RMS ≈ 1.08, flat across pitch. Not a separable scaling
constant — fixing it needs the chip's voiced phase/synthesis.

### 2.6 Handoff (APX firmware) deviations — quality relevance (2026-06-06)

A reverse-engineering hand-off surfaced bit-exact codebooks extracted from the
**Motorola APX `R39.15.00` DSP image** (DVSI *software* IMBE/AMBE+2 on a
TMS320C55x — a different target from the AMBE-3000R hardware chip). Most of its
deviations are **bucket B** (sub-LSB fixed-point artifacts → do NOT copy into the
float path, no quality value). Two are genuinely quality/interop relevant and are
**not currently reflected here or, likely, in open MBE decoders (mbelib/JMBE)**:

- **(FULL-RATE IMBE) DVSI extends the overall-gain ladder ("MONO65"), not plain
  Annex-E.** Decode-reachable part: the **low 8 levels are shifted DOWN** by
  `−0.25·(8−k)` (bottom level −4.842 dB vs Annex-E's −2.842). A decoder using the
  standard 64-level Annex-E renders DVSI/APX-encoded *quiet* frames (gain index
  0..7) **too loud by up to ~2 dB** — an audible level/interop error on low-energy
  speech. (The advertised "65th level" at +9.9199 is NOT decode-reachable — `b̂₂`
  is a 6-bit field, 0..63 — so it is an *encoder gain-search clamp ceiling*, not a
  decode entry; relevant only to encoder gain clamping, see §3.1.) **Action for
  blip25-mbe full-rate:** A/B Annex-E vs the APX low-8 downshift on quiet
  full-rate frames; the downshift is the likely-correct DVSI behaviour. Half-rate
  (Annex-O) gain is **un-extended** — no change there.

- **(ENCODE) DVSI's analysis window is a ~250-pt Hann-class window** (α≈0.501,
  reaches a true 0 at the edge) that differs from **all three** TIA windows
  (Annex B/C/I). This is an independent encode spectral-estimation lever — see
  §3.1/§3.2. Pairs with the ambe3000-clone finding that our refinement window is
  **mis-centred ~45 samples** (clips the left tail) — a likely real blip25-mbe
  analysis bug worth fixing regardless of the DVSI window shape.

- **Explicitly NOT quality levers (bucket B, confirmed):** the APX HOC books'
  truncate-toward-zero / ~2045 build scale (≤1 LSB Q11). An ambe3000-clone chip
  A/B (2026-06-06, b5 sweep) measured the entire HOC table effect at 0.07 dB
  band-power LSD — **~3× below the chip's 0.19 dB observability floor** and a
  15/17 coin-flip on which table the chip prefers. The same applies to the
  fixed-point dequant wordlength (~Q5) and the unvoiced fixed-point FFT residual:
  parity-only, no perceptual headroom.

## 3. Encode-side quality levers (PCM → bits), prioritized

The encoder ceiling caps everything — no decoder recovers detail the analyzer
threw away. Validate every change as a PESQ delta in the `ours→chip` cell.

### 3.1 (HIGH) Spectral-amplitude estimation
The known large amplitude RMSE vs chip is a direct timbre deficit at the
source. Audit `codecs::mbe_baseline::analysis::amplitude` and the
`M̃_l → Λ̃ → quantize` path. **Exceed opportunity:** the chip estimates
amplitudes with limited windows/precision; a modern multi-resolution or
reassigned-spectrum estimate can place harmonic energy more accurately. The
*encoder is where modern DSP most cleanly beats 1990s silicon.*

### 3.2 (HIGH) Pitch estimation robustness
Pitch doubling/halving is among the most audible MBE failures (octave jumps,
roughness). The encoder uses a pYIN-style tracker; harden against
octave errors and rapid pitch transitions. **Exceed opportunity:** a modern
pitch tracker (CREPE-class, or robust autocorrelation+HMM smoothing) can beat
the chip's tracker — keep a classical fallback for determinism. **Measure:**
gross-pitch-error rate vs a reference tracker on voiced speech; then PESQ.

> **Empirical correction (2026-06-04, ambe3000-clone
> `encode_pitch_win_2026-06-04`).** The "encode pitch corr ~0.55, ≥40% of the
> gap" framing is a *pooling artifact*. Restricting the chip-vs-§0.3 comparison to
> genuinely-voiced frames (chip voiced-fraction ≥ 0.5 via `expand_vuv`): ω₀
> correlation = **0.99** (clean & mark), median error **~1.5 %** (0.022 oct), and
> **zero octave errors** — the §0.3 tracker is *already chip-grade on voiced
> speech*. The apparent 0.55 corr came entirely from unvoiced/silence frames where
> the chip's pitch is a perceptual don't-care (it drives b0 to the table floor,
> ω₀≈0.05/L=56, for noise-shaping resolution; parity-only, Bucket C). So pitch is
> **not** a high-priority quality lever for matching the chip — §0.3 already tracks
> voiced pitch tightly. The residual is a ±1 quantization cloud (bit-parity, not
> audible) and the unvoiced floor-b0 convention (parity-only). The CREPE-class
> *exceed* opportunity still stands for robustness on hard field audio, but
> "octave-error hardening to reach chip parity" is largely already met. Pitch-
> tracker *window timing* is correct (a +48-sample shift, the §0.5 amplitude
> analog, is a clean NEGATIVE for §0.3 — it only hurts).
>
> **§0.4 refinement walks pitch AWAY from the chip (2026-06-06, ambe3000-clone
> `encode_pitch_refine_2026-06-06`).** Quantizing the raw §0.3 estimate `P̂_I`
> directly (no §0.4 E_R refinement) matches the chip's `b0` *better* than the
> refined pitch on all 3 voiced vectors: exact +11pp (clean), +6 (mark), +16

> The E_R argmin (±9/8 quarter-sample, P̂_I excluded) is *displaced* from the

> amplitude analysis window, so the mis-centred / +48-shifted window (see §3.1
> window note) *also degrades pitch refinement* (clean b0 exact 34.9→27.8 going

> **Validated on a 4th fresh live-chip vector + decode cross-check (2026-06-06,

### 3.3 (HIGH) Voicing (V/UV) decision
Wrong voicing → buzzy (false-voiced) or noisy (false-unvoiced) artifacts,
very audible. Audit `analysis::vuv` band decisions against the chip on borderline
(breathy / fricative) frames. **Measure:** per-band V/UV agreement vs chip on
labelled speech; PESQ on breathy/fricative-heavy clips.

> **Chip-parity finding + REALIZED lever (ambe3000-clone, 2026-06-10,
> `encode_b1_gain_2026-06-10/`).** Measured on 14 cached + 2 fresh live-chip
> vectors: the spec encoder systematically **UNDER-VOICES HIGH BANDS** vs the
> chip — 7.4:1 under- vs over-voicing on pitch-agreed voiced frames, rising
> monotonically with band (slot0 2.9% → slot7 30.5% chip-voices-we-not). Not
> pitch-, energy- or transient-driven. The cause is Eq. 37's pitch/band Θ
> rolloff (coefficient 0.3096): the chip behaves as if it is absent. Dropping

### 3.4 (HIGH, biggest "exceed" lever) Front-end noise suppression / preprocessing
> **Empirical correction (2026-06-04).** DVSI markets in-chip NS (US8315860),
> but the AMBE-3000R **as driven on the bench does NOT run it** — additive
> broadband noise passes through the chip's encode→decode unchanged (gap noise
> floor 0.94×, i.e. not suppressed; `encode_ns_test_2026-06-04/`). It also does
> no AGC/HPF-leveling at the vocoder. So NS is **purely an EXCEED lever, not a
> parity gap** — the chip sets a *low* bar here. (NS may be a config bit the
> chip exposes but the driver doesn't set; either way the deployed comparison
> point has none.)

A modern denoiser (RNNoise-class spectral gating, or
a learned suppressor with a classical fallback) can **substantially exceed** the
chip on noisy field audio (the chip does nothing there). This is likely the largest single
quality-over-chip opportunity for operational P25 traffic. Keep it a
**pre-analysis** stage so the codec core stays clean. **Measure:** PESQ/POLQA on
clean speech + added babble/vehicle noise at several SNRs, `ours→chip` vs
`chip→chip`.

> **MEASURED — GO (2026-06-07).** First data on this lever, run from the
> ambe3000-clone fork (`conformance/baselines/ns_headroom_2026-06-07/`). Corpus:
> clean + dam, each mixed with {white, babble} at {20, 10} dB SNR (8 conditions);
> scored PESQ-nb vs the clean reference. A *crude, untuned* STFT spectral-
> subtraction front-end (alpha=2.0, static lowest-15%-energy noise estimate),
> bolted ahead of an **unchanged** r34 encode→decode, **beats the chip roundtrip
> on 7/8 conditions, mean +0.217 PESQ-nb**. Per-condition exceed margin
> (ours+dn − chip_rt): white20 +0.03, white10 +0.22, dam_white10 **+0.51**,
> dam_white20 +0.36, dam_babble{10,20} +0.35/+0.23, clean_babble10 +0.08; the
> lone loss is clean_babble20 (−0.03). The front-end also lifts our *own*
> roundtrip on all 8 (+0.006..+0.576). Takeaways: (1) the exceed headroom is
> **real and grows as SNR worsens** — biggest on the hardest (low-SNR, vehicle-
> like) cases that dominate real P25 traffic; (2) **babble (non-stationary) is
> the weak spot** of static spectral subtraction — a learned/adaptive suppressor
> (RNNoise, log-MMSE with noise tracking) should widen it; (3) confirms §3.4 as a
> genuine top exceed lever, *not* a parity lever — it leaves the codec core
> untouched. The earlier "input-side spectral subtraction is at best inert"
> remark (near §0.5) was about the *parity/clean* path; on *noisy* input it is
> decisively positive.

### 3.5 (LOW–MED) Encode-side tone detection
Encode-side tone dispatch exists for single/DTMF; verify it matches the chip's
tone handling so alert/Knox/DTMF traffic encodes as tones, not buzzy voice.

## 4. Suggested first session plan

1. **Stand up the scorer.** Confirm PESQ (wideband) runs in
   `conformance/speech-quality`; assemble a clean-speech corpus.
2. **Run the 4-cell matrix** (chip on `pve`) to get the parity gap and attribute
   it to encoder vs decoder. This decides whether to start at §2 or §3.
3. **Decode:** reproduce the per-harmonic envelope divergence (§1, §2.1) on real
   `tv-rc/r33` speech bits; fix the log-mag prediction / §1.10 stage with the
   largest LSD contribution; re-score `chip→ours`.
4. **Encode:** attack amplitude RMSE (§3.1) and pitch robustness (§3.2); re-score
   `ours→chip`.
5. **Claim the easy "exceed" wins:** verify chip artifacts (§2.2) are off by
   default and A/B on dynamic speech; scope the modern front-end denoiser (§3.4).

## 5. Caveats / clean-room
- The chip is a legitimate **black-box oracle** (feed bits/PCM, observe output).
  Do not read copyrighted TIA PDFs or open-source vocoders; derive from
  `~/blip25-specs` derived specs + general DSP/speech-coding knowledge.
- "Better than the chip" must be judged against a **clean-speech reference via
  PESQ/POLQA**, not against chip output (the chip is not the quality ceiling).
- We can only observe the chip's PCM output, never its internal `M̄_l`/state;
  infer envelope/voicing from output spectra.
